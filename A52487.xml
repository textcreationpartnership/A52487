            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE famous and ever to be admired Art of Navigation, having been ſo learnedly handled and written of, not only in all other Languages, but alſo in our Mother-Tongue, by ſo many learned and able men, both of former and of our preſent Age, that it may ſeem impoſſible to write any thing more thereof that hath not already been done by others; yet in my experience which I have ſeen, being at Sea in ſeveral Veſſels, where divers young Mariners have been: I have heard this general Complaint among them, that though the things that are chiefly uſeful for them in their Art may be found in ſeveral Books here
<pb facs="tcp:34967:3"/> and there diſperſed; yet they could wiſh that there were ſuch a Book contrived, that might be ſoley uſeful for them entire by it ſelf, which then would be more convenient for them, and might be purchaſed at a more reaſonable rate than otherwiſe they could be, by buying of ſo many ſorts of Books, which they muſt be conſtrained to do, if ever they intend to be able Proficients in that moſt noble Profeſſion of Navigation, at which they chiefly aimed.</p>
            <p>This Complaint of theirs, was one chief Motive which induced me to collect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſubſequent Treatiſe, which I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to handle in ſuch a methodical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it ought to be read and practiſed by the young Seaman. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a Treatiſe of ARITHMETICK, containing all the Rules thereof, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Seaman to know and practiſe, all or moſt of the Queſtions thereof being made applicable in one kind or other to Nautical Affairs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a Treatiſe of GEOMETRY, containing the firſt Grounds and Principles thereof, with the making and dividing of the
<pb facs="tcp:34967:3"/> Mariners Scale and Compaſs, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the Sphere in Plano, and the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of many Queſtions in Aſtronomy, which are uſeful in Navigation thereby.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you have a Treatiſe of the practick part of NAVIGATION, wherein is ſhewed, after a new experienced way uſed by the Author, how to keep a Reckoning at Sea: the making and uſe of the Plain Sea-Chart: the Doctrine of plain Triangles made applicable to ſuch Queſtions in Navigation as concern Courſe, Diſtance, Rumb, Difference of Longitude, and Departure: likewiſe, a Table of Meridional parts to every third Minute, and the application and uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of exemplified in Queſtions of Sailing by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>'s Chart: with Tables of Longitude and Latitude of Places, of right Aſcenſion, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of certain Fixed Stars, with Rules to keep a Reckoning, and to find the Latitude by the Meridian Altitude of the Sun or Stars.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a ſhort Treatiſe of ASTRONOMY, wherein you have the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles applied to Queſtions in Aſtronomy and Navigation.</p>
            <p>This is the brief Sum and Subſtance of the following Treatiſe, which I commend to the
<pb facs="tcp:34967:4"/> Practice of all young Sea-men, deſiring their kind acceptance of theſe my firſt Labours, which if I ſhall find to be kindly entertained by them, it will encourage me to lanch farther into the more nice and critical part of this moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Science. In the mean time I commend this to them, wiſhing good ſucceſs in all their honeſt and laudable undertakings, and in the interim bid them Farewel.</p>

               <p>THis Table ſignifies thus much, That if there be one Figure alone, it is but ſo many units as there is in its name, as 7 is ſeven ones or units. If there be two Figures, the firſt Figure towards the left hand is as many tens as there is units in its name, and the other Figure is units: As if it were 10, that is ten units: if it were 23, the firſt Figure is two tens, that is twenty units: and the next Figure is 3, that is three units. The next place is hundreds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of three Figures, as 700 is ſeven hundred: 723 is ſeven
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34967:7"/> hundred twenty three. And thus you may count any Number by obſerving the place of any Figure, and in their places gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them their names as you count: As ſuppoſe I have a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, namely 7864319, if you tell from 9 backwards to 7, you will find 7 in the place of millions, then begin and ſay ſeven millions: then if you count again, you will find 8 in the place of hundred thouſands, 6 in the place of ten thouſands, and 4 in the place of thouſands, then to give them their proper Number, you will read thus: Seven millions for 7, eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand for 8, ſixty thouſand for 6, four thouſand for 4, that is, Seven millions eight hundred ſixty four thouſand; then for 3 three hundred, for 1 ten, and for 9 nine units, that is then altogether 7 millions 8 hundred 64 thouſand 3 hundred and ninteen, which is the quantity of units that is in the given Number 7864319.

               <p>DIviſion is that by which one may know (at one operation) any part of a whole Number, provided that the part be not under an unit: by part I mean thus, the third of a number, or the fourth of a number, or the twentieth part of a number, or the like.</p>
               <p>In Diviſion there are four things conſiderable: Firſt, the Dividend; Secondly, the Diviſor; Thirdly, the Quotient; And fourthly, the Remainder after the Diviſion.</p>
               <p>The Dividend is the number which you deſire to have divided, or to have a part known.</p>
               <p>The Diviſor is that which you divide it by, or the name of the part which you would have known.</p>
               <p>The Quotient is the number of units that is contained in the part required.</p>
               <p>And the Remainder of the Diviſion is that part under an unit, which is wanting to the true portion which is left in the Quotient.</p>

               <p>Becauſe there is 3 miles, 3 times 1760 is the number of paces contained in 3 miles: then becauſe 3 foot is 1 pace, multiply 5280 by 3, and it produceth the number of feet that is in 3 miles; then becauſe 12 inches is a foot, multiply your feet by 12, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth 190080, the number of inches contained in 3 miles: and becauſe 3 Barley-Corns make an inch, multiply your inches by 3, and it gives you the number of barly-corns that are in 3 miles, and the ſame is to be underſtood for any other number of miles.</p>

               <p>The Proof of Reduction is the ſame thing which we did laſt, I framed it ſo for brevities ſake. When you would prove any Sum that is brought into a ſmall Denomination (by Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) divide it backwards, beginning with the Product of your laſt Multiplication, and compare them in each as you do it, and if the Sum be right they will agree.</p>
               <p>When you would prove any Sum that is brought into a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Denomination (by Diviſion) then as before you divided, ſo now multiply; for I have ſhewed that Multiplication and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is the Proof one of the other.</p>

               <p>Firſt Multiply your degrees by 60, and it brings them into minutes, add your odd 20 minutes to that Product, and it makes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34967:15"/> the number of minutes in that given number of degrees and minutes: multiply that by 60, and it produceth the number of ſeconds contained in that given number of degrees and minutes: to that Product add your odd 40 ſeconds, and it gives the number of ſeconds contained in the degrees, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and ſeconds, as here in this Example: and the reaſon is, becauſe 60 minutes is a degree, and 60 ſeconds is a minute: The ſame is to be underſtood of the reducing of any number of ſeveral Denominations into one.

               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the Remainder of any Diviſion either in Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the rule of Three, or in any Diviſion, is ſome part of a Unit, namely thus: If the Quotient be ſhillings, the remainder is ſome part of a ſhilling: If the Quotient be pounds, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſome part of a pound. The remainder is the Numerator, and the Diviſor is the Denominator of the Fraction; ſo that if the Quotient were pounds, and the remainder 12, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor is 20, and the Fraction is the 12/20 of a pound, which is 12 ſhillings; the like for any thing elſe.</p>

               <head>The Golden Rule, <hi>or</hi> Rule of Three.</head>
               <p>THis Rule well underſtood, is the Sum of the reſt that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; for they are all (but as it were this Rule) it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Golden Rule,</hi> becauſe it is the Foundation of the reſt: It is called <hi>The Rule of Three,</hi> becauſe three numbers are given to find a fourth.</p>
               <p>Now there is the Rule of Three direct, and the Back Rule of Three: the Rule of Three direct, is for ſuch queſtions as are ſo ſtated, that the third number and ſecond multiplied together, and that Product divided by the firſt gives the fourth.</p>
               <p>The Back Rule of Three is ſo ſtated, that the firſt number
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34967:16"/> and the ſecond are multiplied together, and that Product divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the third, finds the fourth.</p>
               <p>And this is all the diſtinction that I can make between the forward and backward Rule of Three, which is all the Rule of Three: I will not make therefore two diſtinct Rules of them, (but one) therefore pray obſerve this difference:</p>
               <p>In all Queſtions in the Rule of Three there is three things given to find a fourth, which number will have alike proportion to the third, as the ſecond hath to the firſt.</p>
               <p>In ſtating your Queſtion, be ſure let it be ſo that you may ſet your ſum in order with the firſt and third number, ſpeaking both of one thing: I mean if the firſt be Ells let the third be Ells; if the firſt be Degrees, let the third be degrees, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that Degrees can be reduced to.</p>
               <p>If your Sum be ſet with the numbers in ſeveral Denominations, before you bring your Sum in order, you muſt reduce your num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into the leaſt Denomination: As ſuppoſe your Sum was this, If 5 pound 10 ounces of Tobacco, coſt 10 ſhillings 9 pence, what ſhall 510 pounds coſt? Reduce your 5 pounds 10 ounces into ounces, and your 510 pounds into ounces: likewiſe your ſhillings into pence, taking in the odd pence and odd ounces, as I have ſhewed how to do it in page 16 and 17.</p>
               <p>Your Sum being reduced (as I have ſhewed) into the leaſt Denominations, ſet it in order thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> 90 <hi>Ounces coſt</hi> 129 <hi>pence, what coſts</hi> 81600 <hi>ounces?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Sum being in order, conſider whether your third num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber require more or leſs: if it require more, multiply the ſecond number by the greateſt of the two extreams, and divide that Product by the leſſer, it produceth the fourth number in the ſame Denomination that the middle number was.</p>
               <p>If your third number require leſs, multiply the middle num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by the leaſt of the two extremes, and divide that product by the greateſt, and it gives your fourth number in the ſame denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that your ſecond number was; then if you deſire to reduce it into greater Denomination, do it as I have ſhewed already.</p>
               <p>For your better underſtanding of this Rule of Three, I have here following done an Example of it in right Lines, and have found it upon this Queſtion.</p>

               <head>The Rule of Intereſt, and Intereſt upon Intereſt.</head>
               <p>THis is the Rule of Three, for it runs thus:</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>I let</hi> 478 l. <hi>for two years, what ſhall the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it come to, after the rate of</hi> 6 l. <hi>a year, for the lent of</hi> 100 l. <hi>which is the common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it in a year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'll ſet my Queſtion in order thus:</p>
               <p>If 100 <hi>l.</hi> gives 6 <hi>l.</hi> what ſhall the principal 478 give?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Facit</hi> 28 <hi>l.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have found what the Principle hath gained for a twelve-month, next conſider what proportion 12 Months is to the time your money was lent, which was 24 Months: now if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34967:18"/> it had been three times as long a time as 12 Months, you muſt have made it 3 times as much as you find it for 12 Months, but being but twice as much, you muſt make the Uſe to to be twice 28 68/100 which is 57 <hi>l.</hi> 36/100 of a pound; the ſame is to be underſtood of any number elſe; but in ſtead of ſeeing what proportion the time limited for the lent bears with 12 Months, you may work it as you do the Rule of five Numbers, by ſaying (after you have abbreviated your Fraction.)</p>
               <p>If 12 Months give 28 <hi>l.</hi> 68/100, what ſhall 24 Months gain? But I ſay the other way is beſt, after your other manner; If it had been one fourth of the time, it would have been ¼ of the uſe; if one fifth of the time, ⅕ of the uſe. For it ſtands to reaſon, that if 100 <hi>l.</hi> or any other quantity gains 6 <hi>l.</hi> in twelve Months. it gains four times as much in four times the time, or five times as much in five times twelve Months, and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>I might ſay ſomething of Intereſt upon Intereſt, but that differs but little from this: At the years end, add in your ſimple Intereſt to your Principal, and make it one entire Sum till the next year, then add that Intereſt to the Principal the year before, and receive the Intereſt of it: this is all it differs from the former.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And ſo for the reſt: The way to prove one of theſe Queſtions is leſs trouble than the Rule of Three, for after you have done, add all your <hi>Facits</hi> together, and it will make the ſame that was loſt in the whole Stock, or gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the whole Stock, (if the Queſtion be for Gain) and this ſtands, to good reaſon; for every mans Loſs or Gain muſt together be equal to the whole, or elſe they do not

               <p>There is more intricacy in this Rule than I have here cited, but the Foundation-work lies on the Rule of Three, and the intricacy that I ſpeak of, will be underſtood with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: I had thoughts to have ſhewed it, but it is ſhewed as well as can be (I think) by Mr. <hi>Record</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hodder:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it would take up much paper, and I ſhould digreſs from my intentions to Navigation.</p>
               <p>What I have ſhewed ſince I treated of the Rule of Three, is only a ſhew how all Rules depend upon this Golden Rule. Blame me not for being ſo large in Arithmetick; but both that, and all faults elſe, ſeaſon with the Salt of a charitable Conſtruction, remembring that Navigation is imperfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, I end.</p>

               <p>The Poles are two oppoſite places in the Heavens, and are the ends (as it where) of that Line called the Axletree, which the Heavens may be imagined to turn upon: here that Line is called the <hi>Axis of the World.</hi>

               <p>The Horizon is a Great Circle of the Sphere, and divides that part of the Heavens which we do not ſee, from that part which we do ſee: or it is the furtheſt part of the Heavens which we can ſee for the Body of the Sea; it is only to be ſeen at Sea, or upon the ſhore where there is no land between you and it, and ſo you have divers Horizons according to your motion, for as you raiſe one part of the World, you lay the other.</p>

The twelve Signs divide this Ecliptick into twelve equal parts, and to every Sign theee is a Name, and a Character for that Name, and a Month to that Sign; which for your better knowledge I have here following inſerted.</p>

               <p>Six of theſe be Northern Signs, and are in the North part of the Zodiack; and ſix of them are Southern Signs, becauſe they be in the South part of the Zodiack.

               <p>The ſmaller Circles are the Polar Circles and the Tropicks.</p>

                  <head>How to Project a Sphere.</head>
                  <p>THis Sphere or Scheme is projected on this wiſe: Firſt, take an Arch of 60 <hi>deg.</hi> from your Scale of Chords, and deſcribe the Meridian M A E R. Now the reaſon you take juſt 60 <hi>deg.</hi> is becauſe that number of degrees taken from the Scale is the Semidiameter of the Circle the Scale was made by: ſo then whatſoever you take from that Circle, and apply to the Scale, it will be the quantity of it in degrees and minutes; or from the Scale if you take any diſtance, and apply it to the Circle, it will be the ſame quantity upon the Circle, that it was upon the Scale.</p>
                  <p>The Meridian being thus deſcribed, draw the line A R through the Center, which repreſents the Horizon: Croſs that at right Angles, and draw the line E M, which is the Eaſt and Weſt Azimuth.</p>
                  <p>Then becauſe the Sphere is made for the Latitude of 50 <hi>deg.</hi> take 50 <hi>deg.</hi> from your Scale of Chords, and fix one foot in the Horizon at A, and ſet the other foot upwards to B, (make a prick or mark) which is to ſignifie that the North Pole is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated or raiſed above the Horizon ſo many degrees as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is.</p>
                  <p>Keep the ſame diſtance in your Compaſſes, and go to E with one foot, and let fall the other upon the Meridian on the left hand, which will be at G, and will repreſent that point of the Aeqinoctial that cuts the Meridian of that place which is the neareſt point of the Aequinoctial to that Zenith, and is as much below the Zenith, as the Pole is above the Horizon.</p>

And becauſe (as I ſaid before) the outmoſt bounds of the Suns Declination is 23 <hi>deg.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> (either to the Northwards or Southwards of the Aequinoctial, which bounds are expreſſed by the Tropicks) take 23 <hi>deg.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> from your Scale of Chords, and fix your Compaſſes at O in the Aequinoctial, and ſet it off on both ſides to P and N, carry the ſame diſtance to G, and ſet it off in like manner from G to F and H, then draw F P and H N, which are the Tropicks: alſo draw the Ecliptick from F to N, which will fall through the Center. Always ſet the ſame diſtance from both Poles on both ſides upon the Meridian, and draw D C the Artick, and I L the Antartick Circles. And thus you may project a Sphere by a Plain Scale: The like for any other.</p>

               <head>The Meaning of the Terms uſed in the following Work.</head>
               <p>THe Latitude of any place is the Diſtance between the Zenith of that place, and the Aequinoctial in degrees and minutes.</p>
               <p>The Elevation of the Pole is always equal to it, and is the Poles height above the Horizon in degrees and minutes.</p>
               <p>Altitude ſignifies the Height of a thing: If it be meant of a Star, or of the Sun (not being upon the Meridian) it is meant the Diſtance between the Sun or Star and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:34967:32"/>
               <p>Meridian Altitude is the Suns height above the Horizon, when he is upon the Meridian of that place, which is at 12 of the Clock; or at any other time when a Star is upon the Meridian either North or South.</p>
               <p>The Suns true Amplitude of riſing or ſetting ſignifies the number of degrees and minutes that the Sun riſeth from the Eaſt, or ſets from the Weſt points of the Compaſs in the Horizon, as it is found in the Sphere.</p>
               <p>The Suns true Azimuth of riſing or ſetting ſignifies the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (in degrees and minutes) of the Suns riſing or ſetting (in the Horizon) from the North or South points in the Compaſs, as it is found in the Sphere.</p>
               <p>There is the true Amplitude of the Suns riſing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the Magnetical Amplitude; the Magnetical Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude is the degree of the Compaſs that he is obſerved to riſe or ſet upon, and is Called Magnetical Amplitude from the Load-ſtone: The Magnetical Azimuth is Called ſo for the ſame reaſon, and is the Suns riſing from the South or North.</p>
               <p>Longitude is the Eaſting or Weſting between two places in degrees and minutes, if in ſailing.</p>
               <p>Departure from the Meridian is the Eaſting or Weſting between two places in miles or leagues.</p>
               <p>Latitude, as I have ſaid, is the Diſtance of the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial from the Zenith of that place in degrees and minutes, or the Elevation of the Pole; but Difference of Latitude is the Northing or Southing that a Ship makes in any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance run, or between two places, either in degrees, leagues, or miles.</p>
               <p>Declination (if it be meant by the Sun, or any Star that is near the Aequinoctial) is the neareſt diſtance between the Sun or Star and the Aequinoctial.</p>
               <p>Stars that are nearer the Poles, their Declination are their neareſt Diſtance to the Poles.</p>
               <p>The Suns place in the Ecliptick is his neareſt Diſtance from the place where the Suns Parallel of Declination cuts the Ecliptick to the next Aequinoctial point, which is ♈ or ♎.</p>

                  <p>Note that at O the Sun riſeth, at P it is 6 of the Clock, and P I is equal to ♈ K (when it is extended to a great Circle) and both the Sine of 90 <hi>deg.</hi> which is extended to a Chord, muſt be the Chord of as many degrees, which is 6 hours in time.

                  <p>THe Suns Azimuth at 6 of the Clock, is the neareſt diſtance between the Sun at 6 of the Clock, and the Eaſt and Weſt Azimuth, which is P z: Now if you mind it, P z is taken off from a Circle, which is not ſo great as the Horizon, and yet is parallel to it, as the line n w is parallel to the line M E; and as many degrees as the Sun is from the neareſt part of the Eaſt and Weſt Azimuth in the little Circle, ſo many he is from it (if an Azimuth where drawn) in the great Circle, for P z is as many degrees in the little Circle, as n ♈ is in the great one: Now becauſe your Scale is made by the great Circle, therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the diſtance taken from the leſſer Circle to the meaſure of the greater, which is done thus:</p>
                  <p>Take half the length of the pricked line which is z w, and fixing one foot of your Compaſſes in the Center of the Sphere, deſcribe an Arch from ſome line that goeth through the Center of the Sphere, as the Arch M l n, then ſet the diſtance z P as a Sine upon that Arch (for it is a Sine upon that Arch as well as o ♈ was a Sine upon the Meridian) I find the Sine of it is the Sine of the Arch l M, lay your Scale from the Center of the Sphere by l, and draw the line l q then ſhall q M be the ſame quantity of degrees upon the great Circle, as l M is upon the little one: therefore take M q and apply it to the Scale of Chords, and it anſwers your deſire. And thus is the Suns Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth at 6 of the Clock, P z found to be 8 <hi>deg.</hi> 36 <hi>min.</hi> to the Northwards of the Eaſt, and this is called <hi>The third way of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring,</hi> to meaſure any diſtance from a line that doth not go through the Center (which muſt repreſent a ſmall Circle) And thus you may find the Suns Azimuth at any time of the day.</p>

                  <p>THe Difference of Aſcenſion, is the portion of time that is between the Suns Riſing and ſix of the Clock: If the days be longer than the nights, the Sun riſeth before 6; but if ſhorter, after 6; but whether it be before or after 6 that he riſeth, ſo many hours and minutes as it is from 6, ſo much is the half day or night longer or ſhorter than 6 hours, from whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if the Sun riſeth due Eaſt, he riſeth at 6 of the Clock, and ſo there is no Difference of Aſcenſion, for he is then in the Aequinoctial, which cuts the Horizon in the two oppoſite points of Eaſt and Weſt.</p>
                  <p>In this Queſtion the Difference of Aſcenſion is O P, and is a diſtance upon a line that goeth not through the Center, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take half the length of the parallel I D, and proceed as you did in the third Queſtion, and after you have found it in degrees and minutes, convert it into hours and minutes of time, and ſet it down.</p>

                  <p>THe Sun is due Eaſt (in this Example or any other) when he goeth by the Eaſt point of the Horizon; or Weſt, when he goeth by the Weſt point. In this Example, the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the Eaſt and Weſt Azimuth in S, which is later in the morning than 6 of the Clock, by the diſtance S P: therefore ſee what S P is by <hi>The third way of Meaſuring,</hi> and convert it into time, and add it to 6 hours, it ſhall give the hour of the Suns being due Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>I find it in this Example to be 6 <hi>h.</hi> 46′.</p>
                  <p>Subtract this from 12 hours, and it gives the time of the Suns being due Weſt that day: for as many hours and minutes as the Sun is due Eaſt before 12 of the Clock, ſo many hours and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes muſt it be due Weſt after 12: According to this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Sun is due Weſt at 5 of the Clock 14 <hi>min.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Sun hath South Declination, he paſſeth the point of Eaſt before he riſeth, and is ſet as long before he comes to the point of Weſt, (provided the Latitude be Northerly, as this is) but if the Latitude and Declination be both one way, the Sun is always up before he cometh to the point of Eaſt: and the work is as I have ſhewed.</p>

                     <hi>QUESTION XI.</hi> To find the Length of the longeſt Day in that Latitude.</head>
                  <p>VVHen the Sun is neareſt the Zenith (in any Latitude) that day muſt be the longeſt: now in places near the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, as between the Tropicks, there is but little difference all the year long; but in places nearer the Poles, there is more.</p>
                  <p>The Sun is neareſt the Zenith in this Latitude, when he is in the Tropick of Cancer, ſo that then muſt be the longeſt Day. Imagine the Tripick of Cancer to be the parallel of the Suns Declination (as indeed it is that day) take the diſtance between Y and R, which is between Suns Riſing and 6 of the Clock that day, and ſet it off by the <hi>Third way of Meaſuring,</hi> the number of degrees and minutes convert into time, and add it to 6 hours, which makes the length of the Forenoon, and that doubled is the length of the whole day (as in <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7.) which is equal to the longeſt Night in that Latitude.</p>
                  <p>I find it here to be 16 hours 10 minutes.</p>
                  <p>Subtract the length of this longeſt day from 24 <hi>h.</hi> 00 <hi>min.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it leaves the length of the ſhorteſt night 7 <hi>h.</hi> 50 <hi>min.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Equal to which is the length of the ſhorteſt day 7 <hi>h.</hi> 50 <hi>min.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you may meaſure the length of the ſhorteſt day, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that from 24 hours, and it will be the length of the longeſt night, which is equal to the longeſt day.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſhorteſt day is when the Sun is in the Tropick of Capricorn, for then it is lateſt before he riſeth: Now to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it, take the diſtance from 6 of the Clock, which is T, and the Suns Riſing which is U, and ſet it off by the <hi>Third way of Meaſuring,</hi> convert the degrees into time, and ſubtract that time from 6 hours, it leaves the length of the Forenoon, which doubled is the length of the ſhorteſt day; (as in <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7.) I have ſpoke to that purpoſe. I need ſay no more, that 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Queſtion is light ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>I might do an Example of what is before done, in a South Latitude, but Reaſon gives, that the ſame which the South Pole

                     <p>When the Suns Declination is Southerly (in any Northern Latitude) the days are not ſo long as the nights, ſo that the Sun cannot be up at 6 of the Clock, which is at R; therefore the Suns Azimuth at 6 of the Clock is of no uſe.</p>

                     <p>The Difference of Aſcenſion is here after 6 of the Clock, as much as it was before 6, in the laſt Example: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the Latitude is the ſame, and the Declination of the Sun is juſt as far Southerly, as before it was Northerly, ſo that the Sun will now be juſt as long before he riſeth after 6, as before he roſe ſooner: it is V R, take it off by the third way of Meaſuring, as you did before, and ſet it down; I find it to be 1 hour 5 <hi>min.</hi> 3/15, it ſerves for the ſame uſes that it did in the other Example.</p>

                     <p>For the hour of the Suns being due Eaſt, it is P R, which is from the place where the Sun cuts the Eaſt and Weſt Azimuth

                     <p>Subtract the hour of the Suns being due Eaſt from 12 hours, and it will give the true time of the Suns being due Weſt.</p>

                     <head>The Ecliptick being thus divided into Signs; we may find the Suns place, and right Aſcenſion.</head>
                     <p>THe Suns place in the Ecliptick is the neareſt Diſtance between the next Aequinoctial point, and the Sun in the Ecliptick, (by Aequinoctial points is meant ♈ and ♎, the two points of interſection that the Aequinoctial and the Ecliptick make) Now, in this caſe, the Sun muſt be neareſt the Equinoctial point at ♈, becauſe the Month is belonging to a Sign nearer ♈ than ♎.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, fix your Compaſſes in the point of ♈, and extend the other foot to the Sun in the Ecliptick, which is I, and apply it to the line of Sines; or if you have no line of Sines, convert it to a Chord (by the ſecond way of Meaſuring) and as many degrees as it is, ſo far is the Sun diſtant from the neareſt Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial point; if it exceed 30 <hi>deg.</hi> the Sun muſt be in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ♉ that is above 30 <hi>deg.</hi> if it exceed 60 <hi>deg.</hi> the Sun muſt be in that degree of ♊ above 60; but here I find it in leſs than 30, namely, 29 <hi>deg.</hi> 3 <hi>min.</hi> therefore I conclude the Sun is in 20 <hi>deg.</hi> 3 <hi>min.</hi> of ♈.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe it were time of year that the Sun were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Tropick towards the Aequinoctial, and were the ſame Declination, then would the Suns place be the ſame from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34967:40"/> entring into ♎, that it now is in ♈, namely, in 57 <hi>min.</hi> of ♍, which wants 29 <hi>deg.</hi> 3 <hi>min.</hi> of entring into ♎. Thus much for the Suns place.</p>
                     <p>The Suns right Aſcenſion is meaſured from the place where the Suns parallel of Declination cuts the Ecliptick to 6 of the Clock, which is I 6; ſet it off by the third way of Meaſuring to extend it to a Great Circle: for the Sine of I 6 is equal to the Sine of S ♈; when you have meaſured it, convert it into time, and ſet it down; I find it to be 1 hour 44 <hi>min.</hi>

                  <p>The Rule that we have uſed for reſolving all the Queſtions hitherto laid down was this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Sine of every Angle is proportional to its oppoſite Side, or every Side is proportional to the Sine of its oppoſite Angle:</hi> and this ſerved where you had oppoſite things given, but here you have two ſides, and an Angle between them given, ſo that you have nothing oppoſite to any of them, therefore that general Rule is of no value here in this caſe; this is a general Rule for this caſe, That, As the Sum of the two given Sides is to their Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; So is the Tangent of the half Sum oppoſite Angles, To the Tangent of the Difference of either of them: That is, as the Sum of D B and D A together, is to their Difference, So is the Tangent of the half of A and B, to the Tangent of their Difference. Which Angle added to the half Sum makes the greateſt, or ſubtracted from the half Sum it makes the leaſt Angle. But this Rule though it be rare and true, yet in right angled Triangles we have a briefer way, which we will uſe, and leave this till we come to Oblique Triangles, as a place fitter for it: I only named it here, becauſe I would give notice that my Father in ſaying all, he means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> for he ſaith (Axiom 3. Book 1.) <hi>All plain Triangles,</hi> &amp;c. The reaſon why this Rule is not ſo good here, is this, if you ſubtract the Right Angle which is here always known from 180 <hi>deg.</hi> the Remainder is 90 <hi>deg.</hi> the Sum of the unknown Angles together, the half of which is 45 <hi>deg.</hi> now 45 <hi>deg.</hi> is the Radius of a Tangent, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether you take it or no, for it muſt be caſt away in your work: and therefore if you only take the Logarithm an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the Sum of the two Sides comp. arith. and the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithm of the Difference of them and add them together, they will produce this Angle of the Difference, which added to 45 <hi>deg.</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:34967:50"/> is the greater or ſubtracted is the leſſer; but which is better, you may do it with leſs trouble this way. Say for the Courſe,</p>

Alſo, ſubtract the Difference of Longitude that you have made, (provided that it be that way which ſhortens your Longitude between the place you ſet from, and are bound to,) from the whole difference of Longitude between the two places, and the remainder will be what is ſtill between you and the place you are bound to: but if your departure which you have made, hath increaſed the difference of Longitude between the place you ſet from, and are bound to, add the remainder (after your ſubtracting the Columns one from the other) to the whole difference of Longitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the places; the like for Latitude.</p>

               <p>Suppoſe the Iſland of <hi>Ditiatha</hi> lies ſo, that it hath been found to have 950 Leagues departure Weſt, from the Meridian of the <hi>Lizard</hi> (according to the Courſes that be ordinarily ſailed by <hi>Plano</hi>) the Latitude of it is 16 <hi>deg.</hi> 16 <hi>min.</hi> North Latitude, the <hi>Lizard</hi> lies in the Latitude of 50 <hi>deg.</hi> 00 <hi>min.</hi> Now upon ſome Occaſion that fell in the term of our Voyage, namely, the 29th. of <hi>January</hi> on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the Captain demands of me, what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>Ditiatha</hi> was from me by <hi>Plano,</hi> how it bears, what Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of Departure I have to it, and the like: I look in my Reckoning, and I find in the Weſt Column 434 Leagues, I look in the Eaſt Column and ſee 60 Leagues; I ſubtract 60 (my whole Eaſt Column) from 434 (the whole Weſt Column) and the Remainder is 374 Leagues; which ſignifieth the Ship hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Meridian of the <hi>Lizard</hi> 374 Leagues Weſt; for the Weſt Column was greateſt.</p>
               <p>Subtract this Weſt departure 374 Leagues, from 950 the whole Departure, and I find there is ſtill wanting 576 Leagues; This 576 Leagues is the Departure that is from the Meridian that my Ship is in, and <hi>Ditiatha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Subtract alſo the Latitudes one from the other, (namely, the Latitude your Ship is in, and the Latitude of <hi>Ditiatha</hi>) and the Remainder is the Difference of Latitude in degrees and minutes between the Ship and the Place you are bound to, which in this Example I find to be 6 degrees 24 minutes. Take the Latitude out of the Column of Latitude for that day in the Reckoning, and you will find it ſo, if you ſubtract 16 <hi>deg</hi> 16 <hi>min.</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the Difference of Latitude between you, that day, and your Port, and the Departure that the Port hath from the Meridian that you are in that day, given you to find the things demanded; I will not work it, for it hath beeen ſhewed ſufficiently already.</p>
               <p>I have here following ſet down a Reckoning, and afterwards how I work it, and laſtly the reaſon that makes me uſe this way of keeping my whole Reckoning in the laſt line, ſo that I am not troubled to add it up, when I give account of it.</p>

                  <p>Alſo, I carry the Weſt departure along in its full number of Leagues in the ſame line, without increaſe or decreaſe, till ſuch time as I have more to increaſe it, and then I increaſe that, and carry the whole Eaſting with it in the ſame line: and thus you have need to look upon nothing, but the laſt line, to reſolve you any thing that you deſire, either of your courſe made good ſince you ſet out, your diſtance upon a ſtraight line that you have failed, your Ports bearing from you, what departure is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                  <p>I commonly ſet down the Eaſting or Weſting between the place I ſet and the place I am bound to at the beginning of my reckoning, as alſo the Latitude of each place, as I have done here. You may ask why I do not ſet down the courſe that I made good every day: indeed that is not unneceſſary, but the reaſon why I omit it is, Firſt, becauſe I find it of little uſe in my Reckoning; and ſecondly, I find it can be better expreſſed in a Journal which is kept with my Reckoning; and indeed there I ſet it with the Winds, and the reaſons for ſteering upon ſuch Courſes: but I leave every one to their own Judgment for that, as alſo for Diſtances and Winds, for Difference and Variation.</p>
                  <p>It would have been neceſſary here to have ſet down ſome Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to have worked Triangles by, for (as I have ſaid) ſometimes in 24 hours you have a Travis of 4 or 5 ſeveral courſes, and to work them this way may ſeem tedious.

               <hi>CONCERNING</hi> the <hi>VARIATION</hi> OF THE COMPASS.</head>
            <p>THere is always two things given to find the Variation of the Compaſs; that is, the true Amplitude of the Suns riſing, and the Magnetical Amplitude of the Suns riſing or ſetting: the true Amplitude of the Suns riſing, is, (as I have ſaid before in another place) the true and abſolute quantity of degrees, that the Sun riſeth from the Eaſt, (either Northwards or Southwards) or ſets from the Weſt, and is found (as I have before ſhewed) in the uſe of the Sphere.</p>
            <p>The Magnetical Amplitude of the Sun, is what the Sun riſeth from the Eaſt, or ſets from the Weſt by the Compaſs: Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt gives the Truth how far the Sun riſeth from the Eaſt, or ſets from the Weſt; therefore whatſoever difference there is between them, ſo much is the variation.</p>
            <p>As now, Suppoſe I find in a certain Latitude ſuch a day of the Month (by the Sphere) that the Sun riſeth to the Northwards of the Eaſt 17 degrees; that is, the true Amplitude: but I obſerve the Sun at her Riſing, with an Azimuth Compaſs (which is made for that purpoſe) and find that ſhe riſeth but Eaſt 10 degrees Northerly; then I conclude the Variation is 7 <hi>deg.</hi> 0 <hi>min.</hi> or the Compaſs is falſe ſo much; ſo that whereas if I direct my Courſe Eaſt 10 degrees Northerly by the Compaſs, I do not go on that Courſe, but I go Eaſt and by North 5 <hi>deg.</hi> 45 <hi>min.</hi> Northerly, which is juſt 7 <hi>d.</hi> from my expectation, or Eaſt 17 <hi>deg.</hi> Northerly,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34967:57"/> the true Amplitude. Now that is a groſs error, and in long runs may deceive a man much, and perhaps be a means to loſe a Ship, when one little thinks of it; and therefore it ought to be looked to.</p>
            <p>An Azimuth Compaſs is no other in effect, but a Compaſs fitted for the exact taking of the Sun at her Riſing or Setting, or upon other certain times of the day, as you may have occaſion.</p>
            <p>In like manner you may find the Variation of the Compaſs at other times, by taking the Suns Azimuth at any time of the day.</p>
            <div type="example">
               <head>Example.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suppoſe I were in the Latitude of</hi> 33 deg. 20 min. <hi>Northerly, and upon the</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                     <hi>day of</hi> November <hi>the Suns Declination is Southerly</hi> 19 deg. 20 min. <hi>I demand the Suns Azimuth at</hi> 8 <hi>of the Clock.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>The Suns Azimuth at her Riſing (as I have ſhewed) is the Complement of the Suns Amplitude; but after the Sun is up, it may be alſo the Diſtance of the Sun from the Eaſt and Weſt Azimuth: Now in this Propoſition, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know how many Degrees the Sun is from the Eaſt and Weſt Azimuth, (which is that Part of the Heavens that is diſtant from the Sun) parallel to the Horizon over the Eaſt Point of it; or if it had been at 4 of the Clock in the Afternoon, it would have been required from the Weſt Point.</p>
               <p>For the reſolving this Queſtion project a Sphere (as hath been taught) for the Latitude propoſed, with the Parallel of the Suns Declination drawn as it is given: Divide this Parallel of Declination into the hours of the day from 6 to 12, or which ſerves from 12 to 6 in the Afternoon; the way to divide it is thus; From 6 of the Clock ſet off 15 degrees by the third way of meaſuring, which will be 7, then (becauſe 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees is two hours in time) next ſet off 30 degrees by the third way of Meaſuring from 6, and it makes 8 a Clock; then take
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34967:58"/> 45 <hi>deg.</hi> which is three hours, and it makes 9 a Clock, then 60 <hi>deg.</hi> for 10 a Clock, then 75 <hi>deg.</hi> for 11 a Clock, and then 90 <hi>deg.</hi> which will juſt fall in the place where the Sun comes to the Meridian for 12 a Clock. Thus you divide the Parallel of the Suns Declination into hours, as you may ſee in the Sphere here following: it being thus divided, the Suns Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth at 8 of the Clock is 8 ſ, taken off by the third way of Meaſuring, I find it to be 33 <hi>deg.</hi> 0 <hi>min.</hi> (by the Scale) ſo it is certain that the Sun ſhould be juſt 33 <hi>deg.</hi> 0 <hi>min.</hi> to the Southwards of the Eaſt at 8 of the Clock, then I will ſee how high he ſhould be at that time, and I find him to be 13 <hi>deg.</hi> 50 <hi>min.</hi> equal to ſ ♈, take off ſ ♈ by the ſecond way of Meaſuring. I will obſerve the Sun till I find him at that height, and then I know it is 8 of the Clock; ſee by your Azimuth Compaſs whether he be 33 <hi>deg.</hi> 0 <hi>min.</hi> from the Eaſt or no, and if not, what it differs, ſo much is the Variation of the Compaſs.</p>
               <p>I have wrought this Example no nearer than the plain Scale works it, which poſſibly may be 15 <hi>min.</hi> or half a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Compaſs out of the way, but that is no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable error in a Courſe, which is the thing we here uſe it for.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be done at any time of the day, as La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 32 <hi>deg.</hi> 20 <hi>min.</hi> North, Declination 19 <hi>deg.</hi> 20 <hi>min.</hi> South.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe it were cloudy, but at ſome time the Sun breaks out, ſo that I have an opportunity to take his height with my Quadrant, and alſo his magnetical Azimuth with my Azimuth Compaſs: Now I find his height to be r t, equal to N P, and the Azimuth at that time is N t, it being drawn parallel to the Horizon; this N t ſet off by the third way of Meaſuring, and ſo much as it comes to, ſo much is the true Azimuth of the Sun from the Eaſt towards the South: Take your magnetical Azimuth at the ſame time, and as much as they differ, ſo much is the Variation: And thus much for the Variation of the Compaſs.</p>

               <p>When a man obſerves the Sun with a Quadrant (which is our uſual Inſtrument) he takes the upper edge, which is to the Northwards in this Latitude. Suppoſe then I ſet from the <hi>Lizard,</hi> and am bound to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> I make obſervations of the Sun as often as I can all the way, till I bring the Sun to the Zenith: after I paſs the Zenith, the edge of the Sun that was higheſt is loweſt: Now he that doth not conſider this, loſeth the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34967:59"/> bredth or Diameter of the Sun, ſo that your obſervations may differ from your expectation 30 miles, which is enough to miſs an Iſland; therefore I adviſe you always to allow the Suns Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter (which ſome count 30 <hi>min.</hi>) to every obſervation you make in places where the Sun is to the Northwards of you; that is, make your Meridian Altitude 30 <hi>min.</hi> leſs than it is, which is the Altitude of the lower edge, which was your upper edge before you croſſed the Zenith, where the Sun was; or if you work your obſervations by the Complement of his height, make that 30 <hi>min.</hi> more.</p>
               <p>I confeſs the beſt way would be at all times to ſubtract the Semidiameter of the Sun, which is 15 <hi>min.</hi> from your Meridian Altitude: But becauſe the Latitude of Places are not ſet down with this conſideration, it is more ſafe to do as before, unleſs you know otherwiſe by your own experience. This only by the by to give notice.</p>

               <p>Suppoſe I obſerve the Sun at <hi>Barbadoes</hi> the 11th. day of <hi>December,</hi> and I find that the Meridian Altitude of the Suns upper edge is 53 <hi>deg.</hi> 18 <hi>min.</hi> to which I add the Suns Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for that day, which is Southerly 23 <hi>deg.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> and it gives the height of the Aequinoctial above the Horizon of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the Latitude to 90 degrees, which is 76 <hi>deg.</hi> 48 <hi>min.</hi> which ſubtracted from 90 degrees, leaves the Latitude or Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial's Diſtance from the Zenith, 13 <hi>deg.</hi> 12 <hi>min.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the 11th. of <hi>June,</hi> I obſerve the Sun again in the ſame place, and I find the Meridian Altitude of the upper edge of the Sun is 80 <hi>deg.</hi> 12 <hi>min.</hi> (Note that this upper edge is oppoſite to the edge before, for the Suns Declination is 23 <hi>deg.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> Northerly, which makes that the Sun gives a South Horizon) I add the Suns Declination to the Meridian Altitude, and it gives 103 <hi>deg.</hi> 42 <hi>min.</hi> the Diſtance between the Aequinoctial and the North Horizon, from which ſubtract 90 <hi>deg.</hi> and the remainder is the Aequinoctial's diſtance from the Zenith, or the Latitude which is 13 <hi>deg.</hi> 42 <hi>min.</hi> Now this Latitude ſhould agree with the other, for the place ſtands ſtill; but for want of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34967:59"/> this ſubtracting the Semidiameter of the Sun, it differs 30 <hi>min.</hi> and when men meet with things thus at Sea, for want of minding of this they run 30 <hi>min.</hi> more Southerly than they ſhould do, which I ſuppoſe may be the greateſt reaſon of their miſſing this Iſland, and others that lie near the Aequinoctial; but for thoſe places that lie far from the bounds of the Sun, it is not to be minded: Yet it were good (methinks) if all Places had been laid down with allowance for the Suns Semidiameter; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not, you ought to be careful, when at any time you croſs the Zenith of the Sun: I have not been my ſelf in a time of year to croſs the Suns Zenith, and therefore I only ſet this down by way of Caution to thoſe that may.</p>

               <p>The way that the Square E C D is divided into Points, is on this manner: Firſt, I draw the line O C, then the other lines for half-points, and quarter-points, then I deſcribe the Circles, making the outmoſt come to the innermoſt of the lines (but whether it be or no is no great matter) the Circles being divided into Points, half-points, and quarters, I lay my Scale by the Center of theſe Circles, which is O, and the diviſions on the Circles, &amp; where my Scale cuts upon the outer line, from thence I draw my Points, half-points, and quarter-points, as you ſee here in the following Blank; and the Points upon the ſides of the Square thus ſet off are the Tangents of the Points upon the Arch: for when from the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt edge of an Arch a Perpendicular is raiſed from a ſide that bounds that Arch (as the ſide N 4 is,) and the other ſide that bounds the ſame Arch be extended without the Arch to interſect it (as the line O C interſects N 4 at 4,) that Perpendicular is the meaſure of that Arch, either in degrees or points; as here N W is 45 degrees or 4 points, and ſo is N 4. And thus you may divide a Tangent line for degrees or points, from an Arch divided into degrees or points.</p>

               <p>This Queſtion is wrought as the ſecond Queſtion, for here you have the bearing of the places you note in both Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo the Courſe that you ſteer from one Station to the other, with the Diſtance; which is two Angles and a Side, to find the other two Sides, which is your Diſtance at each Station from the places.</p>
               <p>For the protracting of this Queſtion; from your firſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draw a line upon thoſe ſeveral Courſes, as the Queſtion ſaith the places bear; As, ſuppoſe the firſt Station be A, from A draw A I a N N E line, and (mind) that line muſt be cut upon the Eaſtermoſt Head-land, becauſe the Queſtion ſaith it bears ſo.</p>
               <p>Next draw a N W line from A, which is A C, and cuts the the Weſtermoſt Head-land.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, draw out a South line from A, which is A D, and cuts the Iſland.</p>

If you had ſet it in paces, and wrought to the tenth part, you would have been out but 2/10 of a pace, therefore uſe your mind in ſuch caſes. If you had wrought to Centiſms, you would have been nearer: but this I count near enough for ſailing, and I am ſure is more proper to be uſed, than ſuch ſmall Fractions, becauſe no long diſtances can be gueſſed to a mile or a league.

                  <p>The reaſon that the proportion ſtands thus, is becauſe the Angles are equal in each Triangle, and therefore the ſides muſt be proportional.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:34967:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Thus the Eaſtermoſt Ship ſailed 10 7/10 leagues, the Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 8 leagues, and the Eaſtermoſt Port bears from the Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Eaſt 4 <hi>deg.</hi> 14 <hi>min.</hi> Northerly.</p>
                  <p>There is no Diſtance that a man ſails, but if he returns the ſame way that he went out, he ſhall find the ſame Diſtance back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as he did out.</p>
                  <p>But now, the World is round, and if a man goeth out one way, and returns another (as it is common) he will find a great deal of difference in long runs. For to demonſtrate the reaſon of this I ſhall not, becauſe my Father and others have done that ſufficiently, beſides, it would take up too much room in this little Book.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Queſtions of Sailing may be underſtood in ſuch caſes as this is, namely, when a man ſails the ſame way home as he doth out: But becauſe the Winds will not ſuffer a man to do ſo, it is neceſſary to know ſome better way to ſail by. Let a man return never ſo contrary to what he ſailed outwards, yet at all times to know how near or how far he may be off.</p>
                  <p>Now there is no way better than <hi>Mercator</hi>'s way of Sailing, it is very excellent, and hath been treated of by many, and that makes me preſume to think that I may treat of it as well as others.

               <head>A Declaration of the Table of <hi>MERIDIONAL PARTS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THeſe Tables are in my Fathers Works to every ſix mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, but here to every three minutes; ſo that if a man light not upon the very number that he deſireth, he may the eaſier take it, for it will be but one third or two thirds of the Difference between the two neareſt to be added or ſubtracted; I ſuppoſe it will be the leſs troubleſom; I have gone no farther than ſixty degrees, becauſe I would not take up too much room, and I ſuppoſe there is but little Trading to the Northwards of that Latitude, ſo that it would have been ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in uſe, Theſe Tables were calculated by my Fathers Tables.</p>
               <p>He that ſails according to <hi>Mercator</hi>'s Projection, notes the true Quantity of Longitude in degrees and minutes, namely, ſuch degrees as in that Parallel, 360 makes the Circumference. But they which ſail by <hi>Plano,</hi> meaſure the Sea, which is round, as though it were a flat or plain, now it ſtands to reaſon that there muſt be great Difference: as thus,</p>
               <p>All North and South Courſes (which we call Meridians) interſect in the Poles: Now ſuppoſe there be two Ships under the Aequinoctial, 5 degrees or 100 leagues aſunder, and theſe Ships ſail both North, they will meet in the North Pole of the World, but by <hi>Plane</hi> they count them as far off there, as they were at firſt, for all North and South Lines are parallel one to another, as you may ſee in the Work all along.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Illuſtration.</head>
                  <p>All Meridian Lines (as I ſaid before) cut through the Poles of the World, and all Parallel Lines go round about the Poles, continuing the ſame diſtance from them. The Aequinoctial is one of theſe Parallel Lines, drawn equally diſtant from the Poles, and ſo is upon the body of the Earth; and there a degree of Longitude is 60 miles, and 360 times 60 miles is the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Earth, which is 360 degrees.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:34967:87"/>
                  <p>But now if there be a drawn Parallel, 50 degrees nearer to one of the Poles, our own reaſon will give that that Circle will not contain ſo many miles round as the other did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt be leſs; yet he that ſails by <hi>Plano</hi> counts that it doth, and though he hath Winds that carry him no better than due North from the Aequinoctial to the Parallel or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 50 degrees, he counts he hath as many Leagues from the Meridian of the Place he is bound to, as he had when he was under the Aequinoctial. Now tell me how it is poſſible, (if Meridians interſect in the Poles, as they do) that theſe Meridians ſhould be as far aſunder upon a Parallel of 50 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees nearer the Poles, as they were under the Aequinoctial: I hope you underſtand me.</p>
                  <p>It is the work of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rcator</hi> to ſhew (therefore) the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a degree of Longitude in every Latitude, (for in theſe Parallels there is 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0 degrees in the Circumference, but theſe degrees cannot contain ſo many miles as they do nearer the Aequator) It ſheweth how you may ſail upon any Courſe from one Latitude to another, and reckon your Longitude according to the truth of it in degrees and minutes: So that having two things given beſides the right Angle, you may find your deſire at Sea according to <hi>Mercator</hi>'s Direction, which is the ſureſt way of Sailing that I know, except Sailing by the Arch of a great Circle, and that and this will agree in degrees of Longitude, but that ſheweth the neareſt way to ſail from place to place, which is all that it differs from this, (they being both true) this ſheweth a general way of ſailing from place to place, that a particular way of ſailing the neareſt way from place to place: It is but ſeldom uſed, becauſe it is not very commonly known, but it is an excellent thing, I thought to have touched it, but I conſidered that my Father hath demonſtrated it as evidently as can be. For <hi>Mercator</hi> uſe the Tables here inſerted.</p>

            <head>OF ASTRONOMY.</head>
            <p>I Had thoughts to have handled the Doctrine of Spherical Triangles fully, but if I ſhould, I might do that which my Father hath done before, better than I can; the thing which induced me to this thought was that I might make the Application of it to Great Circle ſailing; but becauſe that way of ſailing (though the beſt) is ſeldom uſed, I have not ſet it in my Book; if you deſire to know it, you may ſee the way of it in my Fathers works, as plainly as (I think) it can poſſibly be demonſtrated by any man.</p>
            <p>I have thought good to make uſe of his fundamental Axiom, to ſhew how to reſolve thoſe Queſtions in the Sphere, which I have wrought in this Book by the Plain Scale, though I confeſs (for Amplitudes of Riſing and Setting, and Azimuths at certain given hours, with divers other things that are chiefly to be minded at Sea, for the Variation of the Compaſs, and other neceſſary uſes) I hold the Plain Scale to be true enough, but that I conceive not to be ſo ſatisfactory to all men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have done this, the Axiom is this:
<q>The Sine of a middle part with Radius, is equal to the Tangents of the Extremes adjacent, or to the Sine Complement of the oppoſite Extremes.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:34967:101"/>
            <p>Now for Brevities ſake it is common to uſe theſe Characters, for this Character + ſignifieth with Radius or more, or one Side or Angle with an another, for equal =, for leſs −; ſo that the general Rule or fundamental Obſervation which we purpoſe to uſe, may be expreſſed thus:</p>
            <p>The Sine of the middle part + Radius is = to the Tangents of the Extremes adjacent, or to the Sine complement of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Extremes.</p>
            <p>This Rule being rightly underſtood gives ſuch full directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that a man may reſolve any Queſtion in the Sphere by it, which makes me judge thoſe culpable of a fault, that accuſe him of Prolixity, that made it in ſo brief a manner. I will define a ſpherical right angled Triangle, and ſo come to the uſe of this Axiom.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>If you have two things given beſide the right Angle, to find a third (as you always have) the firſt thing that you are to conſider, is, whether it be an adjacent or an oppoſite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme.</p>
            <p>That is an adjacent Extreme, when the given parts and the required part joyn.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>For Example in Adjacent Extremes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe the given things were A C and A C B, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired thing were C B: Here you ſee that A C is joyning to C,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34967:101"/> and ſo is C B, therefore they all joyn, and C is the middle part, for it is between B C and C A the Extremes.</p>
               <p>That is an oppoſite Extreme that hath two things lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the third thing lieth alone, and that part which lieth alone is the middle part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe the three things (namely the two given things, and the required thing) were B C, the Angle at A, and C A; then I conclude that C B is the middle part, and that it is an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Extreme, becauſe it is alone, and the other thing, namely, C A and A are together: If you ask how this can be, thus:</p>
               <p>A C B is between C B and C A, and A B is between C B and the Angle at A, which proves that B C is alone, and A C and the Angle at A joyns: Then is A C and the Angle at A alſo the two Extremes.</p>
               <p>Pray obſerve this for a Rule, that the right Angle never parts any thing, for if C B, the Side B A, and the Angle at A be the three things, it is nevertheleſs an adjacent Extreme; for though the right Angle be between the Sides B A, and B C, yet do not count that it parts them, (as another Angle would) ſo as to make it an oppoſite Extreme.</p>
               <p>Or if the given and required things were the three Sides, you might judge B A the middle part, becauſe it is alone, for the Angle at A parts it from A C, and the right Angle at B is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween B C and it: Now never count that the right Angle at B parts B C from B A, but that they lie together, and A C lies alone, being parted by the Angle C from C B, and by the Angle A from A B, and ſo is the middle part: Theſe be the firſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations (after you have a Queſtion ſet you) that you ought to mind, without regarding which of the three things is given or required.</p>
               <p>We now come to apply this general Axiom. Suppoſe I have the Side B C given, the Angle at C, and that the Side C A be required.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid I know C to be the middle part and that it is an adjacent Extreme; I will apply the Rule thus, it ſaith
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34967:102"/> the Sine of the middle part, which intimates that the middle part muſt be always ſo called, as you may take the Sine of it; now becauſe its noted to be a Complement, you muſt call it Sine Complement, to find the Sine of it. This done, I will go to one of the Extremes, and conſider what the Axiom ſaith for that, (admit it be the Extreme C B) It ſaith the Sine of the middle part with Radius, is equal to the Tangents of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes adjacent; from whence I conclude, that I muſt call C B ſo, as that I may have the Tangent of it; Now C B is not noted to be a Complement, and therefore I call it Tangent C B. Laſtly, for the other Extreme C A, for the ſame reaſon I muſt call it ſo, as that I may take the Tangent of it: and becauſe it is noted to be a Complement, therefore I call it Tangent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, to have the Tangent of it: Now as I go along thus in my thoughts, I will ſet it down as I conſider it, and it frames this Rule:</p>

               </p>
               <p>My Queſtion being brought into this order, I will conſider which is given and which is required: thoſe which are given, I will ſet down firſt, the thing required undermoſt, and look for them in the Tables by the directions which I have framed from the Axiom.</p>

               <p>And thus this Axiom ſets your buſineſs in order; but now that you may know when to take a Complement arithmetical, or let it a lone; and alſo, that you may know which thing it is that you muſt take the Complement arithmetical of, obſerve this Rule, either in adjacent or oppoſite Extremes.</p>
               <p>That if the middle part and an extreme be given, take the Complement arithmetical of the given Extreme; but if the two Extremes be given, to find the middle part, take no Complement arithmetical at all: This may be ſufficient for all Queſtions in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34967:102"/> right angled Triangles, will fall out one of theſe two ways; this Complement arithmetical is what every figure in the Tables wants of 9: it was firſt invented by my Father, it ſaves a labour of Subtracting, and ſo abbreviates the work much.</p>
               <p>To many which I have taught, it hath ſeemed ſtrange that a thing is called Sine comp. or Tan. comp. (when one is to find the Sine or Tangent of it) but the reaſon of it is this; if a thing be a Complement already (as three things in every right angled ſpherical Triangle is noted to be) the comp. of that Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be the Sine or Tangent of that Complement.</p>
               <p>But pray mind me; I have noted that there are five things in every right angled Triangle conſiderable, beſides the right Angle.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve this for a Rule, (when you are framing your Rule from the general Axiom to work by) that if you call any of theſe five things by their names, you ſhall not have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of them, but call any of them out of their names, and you ſhall; I mean thus. Suppoſe you have a mind to take the Sine of A B, it is noted not to be a Complement, therefore call it Sine A B, to have the Sine of it, or Tangent A B to have the Tangent of it, the like for C B.</p>
               <p>Again, if you have a mind to take the Sine of C A, I conſider that C A is noted by the name of a Complement, call it Sine comp. ſo ſhall you have the Sine of it, or Tangent Complement, and you ſhall have the Tangent of it; the like for the two Angles contrariwiſe: If you have occaſion to take the Complements of them, call them out of their names.</p>

I leave it to your own Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: I find the continuance of Twilight to be 27 <hi>deg.</hi> 4 <hi>min.</hi> which converted into time is 1 <hi>h.</hi> 48 <hi>min.</hi> 4/13 neareſt.</p>

               <p>So I conclude that between the Day breaking and Sun riſing, it is 1 <hi>h.</hi> 48 <hi>min.</hi> 4/15, which is u B: Now if you add this to the Difference of Aſcenſion (before found) B 6, which was 1 <hi>h.</hi> 5 <hi>min.</hi> 3/15 of a minute (I omit the ſmaller Fraction) you have the time between break of day, and 6 of the Clock, which may be termed u B 6 2 <hi>h.</hi> 53 <hi>min.</hi> 7/15.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:34967:109"/>
               <p>And becauſe the day breaks ſo much before 6 of the Clock, if you ſubtract it from 6 hours, you have the hour and minute of day breaking, which is at 3 of the Clock 6 <hi>min.</hi>

               <p>Add it to 6 of the Clock, and you have the time of Twilight ending, which is at 8 <hi>h.</hi> 53 <hi>min.</hi> 7/15.</p>

               <head>To find the Suns Place and Right Aſcenſion, provided, the Latitude and Declination be given.</head>
               <q>Latitude <hi>50 deg. 0 min.</hi> Declination <hi>13 deg. 15 min,</hi> I demand the Suns Place in the Ecliptick and right Aſcenſion.</q>
               <p>RIght Aſcenſion is an Arch of the Aequinoctial between a Meridian, cutting the Aequinoctial and the point of <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Libra;</hi> the Meridian muſt alſo cut the Sun or Star in the Ecliptick as here in this Scheme: A B C is an Arch of the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, cutting the Sun at B in the Ecliptick, and the Aequinoctial in C; then C ♈ is the Suns right Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>The Suns Place (as I ſhewed formerly) is the Suns diſtance in the Ecliptick, from the neareſt Aequinoctial point here B Y.</p>
               <p>To find the Suns place ♈ B, you have given the Angle B ♈ C 23 <hi>deg.</hi> 30 <hi>min.</hi> and C B the Suns Declination 13 <hi>deg.</hi> 15 <hi>min.</hi> in the right angled Triangle B C ♈; it is an oppoſite Extreme, and C B is the middle part, I find it to be 35 <hi>deg.</hi> 5 <hi>min.</hi> if you propoſe the month and the day of the month that the Sun hath this Declination, you may tell what Sign the Sun is in, and what degree of that Sign.</p>

               <p>As ſuppoſe the Sun hath this Declination here given upon the 14th. of <hi>April,</hi> I conſider what Sign belongeth to that Month, and I conclude it is ♉, then ſay I, as much as the Sun is diſtant from the next Aequinoctial point above 30 <hi>deg.</hi> (which is the Sine of ♈) ſo much he is entered into ♉, which is 5 <hi>deg.</hi> 5 <hi>min.</hi> I omit the Fraction.</p>

                  <p>You have the ſame things given in the ſame Triangle, to find the Suns right Aſcenſion C ♈; but this is an adjacent Extreme, and the required thing is the middle part.</p>
                  <p>I find it to be 32 <hi>deg.</hi> 47 <hi>min.</hi> ſome part of a minute more, (but I omit the Fraction.)</p>
                  <p>This muſt be converted into time, and then is your demand fully anſwered, it is 2 <hi>h.</hi> 11 <hi>min</hi> 2/15.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be things neceſſary and very uſeful in Navigation for ſeveral occaſions, and that hath made me inſiſt upon them: If you are unacquainted with this way of working, my Father hath inſiſted upon it largely, and in his works, commonly called <hi>The Doctrine of Triangles;</hi> you may be ſatisfied both in the Doctrine of right lined Triangles, and Spherical. This I judge ſufficient for the two kinds of Sailing.</p>
                  <p>I would have handled ſomething in oblique Spherical Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and ſo have proceeded to that incomparable way of Sailing by the Arch of a Great Circle; but the goodneſs of it is not known becauſe it is not practiſed: If you love that way of Sailing, (Reader) I commend thee to my Fathers <hi>Doctrine of Triangles</hi> in large, where it is largely treated of.</p>
